# Coin Flip ... are you felling lucky?

#1. The big takeaway for this assigment was promises

#2. I took is a step further and created a button that could be clicked to make the flips happen. I did build it where you had to click on the button for every flip, but who wants to click a button 100 times to get a million dollars...actually, I think people would be willing to do that! HA! 

Anyways, I learned that state is slower than let varialbes, and they don't update as fast. I also found a cool package called CountUp, that makes the numbers count up once the coin is flipped! Fun project! enjoy
