# Hook Form..again?

Yup its the "same" as the other Hook form. But this one has more! 

To make sure I truly understood all I've learned, I decided to go back and redo all my assigments. The idea was practice and to do the assigments in both class componets and functional components! 

Of course there were rabbit holes I went down, the checkboxes were the funniest! Checkout file: src/components/SuperHeroFormClass.js
