# MERN

M - Mongo/MonGoose </br>
E - Express </br>
R - React </br>
N - Node </br>

Also used Postman, JS, HTML, CSS, npm

This folder if FULL, probably too full of MERN stuff! And I must say I do love me some react. If you're familiart with JS and ES6 React should be no problem!

And of course, with a new folder I must find a new Mmme! What's ironic about this one is I've been told something similar. HA! Jokes on them</br>
