# Box Generator

This assigment was on lifing state values, making props variables (that is still so cool), and maping

The "non-bonus" parts of this asigment wasn't too bad. but something about having to take if further with no reference. It was fun, gonna have to do it a few more times to make sureI understood what I ended up doing! 

Not the project started out as making pizzas cause I was hungry and then it turned into colors becaue thats what the assigment kept taking about and I was getting confused on the bonus part! Not the cleaniest code, I'll do better next time
