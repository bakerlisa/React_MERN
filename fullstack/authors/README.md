I know I know! don't hate me, I'm working on the styles. I've got a life you know...geezs :) 

Things to look for:
1. 404 page - any pages that doesn't have a route set up goes here
2. array management/saving/updating/deleting with titles and genres 
3. Likes button
4. Look at the file structure for componets (its getting cleaner and more modularized)
