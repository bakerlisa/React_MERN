Again, not pretty I'm working on things I need to get better for the exam tomorrow, so sorry :/ I don't like it either

Things to look for:
1. 404 page
2. array management thats going on in the backgroudn with books and genres 
3. Likes on the home page
4. Look at the file structure for componets (its getting cleaner and more modularized)
