# Box Generator

This assigment was on lifing state values, making props variables (that is still so cool), and maping

The "non-bonus" parts of this asigment wasn't too bad. but something about having to take if further with no reference. It was fun, gonna have to do it a few more times to make sureI understood what I ended up doing!
