# Coin Flip ... are you felling lucky?

In this assigment we weorked with promises

I took is a step further and created a button that one could press to make the coin flip. I learned that state is slower than my let varialbes. I have to wait till the for loop is compolete before updating my state. I also found a cool package called CountUp, that makes the numbers count up once the coin is flipped! Fun project! enjoy
