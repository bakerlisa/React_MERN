# Authors

I finally got around to making this one look pretty! Still a few things I'd like to do to round it out a bit, but I feel better about the look and feel!

Technical things I worked on:
1. 404 page - any pages that doesn't have a route set up goes here
2. array management/saving/updating/deleting with titles and genres 
3. Likes button
4. Look at the file structure for componets (its getting cleaner and more modularized)
